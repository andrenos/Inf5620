 * Extensive tex report not necessary here, but good anyway.
 * Nice, clean implementation. Some more commenting necessary, docstring == good.
 * ArgParser() good.
 * Good implementation of tests, everything is running fine too. Good.
 * Obviously, from a programers point, there are a lot of things here that could have been done
 a lot easier. However that was not the main point of the exercise. You have clearly grabbed all the 
 important aspects.
 * Programs as lengthy as this would look a lot better when implemented with classes, functions where ok too.

Approved.
